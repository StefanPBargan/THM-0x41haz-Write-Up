**OhSINT Room Description:** “Are you able to use open source intelligence to solve this challenge?”

This room has a heavy focus on **OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence), there is only 1 Task in this Room but to complete this room you will need to answer 7 questions.

*“Open-source intelligence is a multi-factor methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. In the intelligence community, the term “open” refers to overt, publicly available sources. — Wikipedia”*
